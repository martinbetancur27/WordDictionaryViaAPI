# Through a console program that consumes an API, you can have many meanings of a word. DotNet 6


I programmed the logic of the API 'https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}' from the web page https://dictionaryapi.dev/


Functions:
===
- Many definitions of a word.
- You can have examples of each definition.
- Save the result of the definitions in a txt file.
- You can scale the logic to complement the other API fields.

Test the logic of the program

Warning

I did not remove the other unused attribute fields so this repository can be easily scaled. It is a logical base of the API.
